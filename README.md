# Notes about my project

1. Because of the way the assets are in Adobe XD, I was unable to get the exact font styles used in the template.
2. Instead of just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I used my own React workflow. So the project is split into multiple components.

   I'll provide both a link to GitHub and a link to CodeSandBox where the project can be opened in a browser.
   The project on CodeSandbox only contain the files of the dist/ folder when the project is built. The full code is on the GitHub.
