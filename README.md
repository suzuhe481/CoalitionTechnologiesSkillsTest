# Notes about my project

1. Because of the way the assets are in Adobe XD, I was unable to get the exact font styles used in the template.
2. Instead of just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I used my own React workflow. So the project is split into multiple components.

   I'll provide both a link to GitHub and a link to CodeSandBox where the project cna be opened in a browser.
   The project on CodeSandbox only contain the files in the dist/ folder when the project is built. The full code is on the GitHub.

# The Project

## CodeSandBox

1. Just open the link below. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript used are the resulting files from the dist folder after the React project gets built.
